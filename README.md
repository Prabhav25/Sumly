## Key Features

- **Askable: [Demonstration](https://prabhavdev.me/sumly/askable)**
  - Stuck on any question (coding, multi-select, etc.)? Just select the text where the question is, open the extension, click on **Askable**, select any **Answer type**, and get an instant answer.
  - If the website does not allow text selection, open the extension, click on **Askable**, then click on **Canvas** and select the area of the page containing your question. Click on Save. Open the extension again, click on Askable, and select an Answer type, and get an instant answer.
  - If your question is a coding question and you want to generate code for it, use the **Write code** answer type and choose the language in which you want the code to be generated.
  - We support multiple answer types:
    - **Single select**: Choose this if your question has only one correct answer.
    - **Multi select**: Use this if your question has multiple correct answers.
    - **Write code**: Use this to generate code for a coding question with support for **15 programming languages**.
    - **Code output**: Use this to generate the output of a code snippet.
    - **True/False**: Use this for true or false type questions.
    - **Fill in the blanks**: Use this if the question asks to fill in missing parts.
  - To make sure the entire question is visible in a single view when using Canvas Selection, you can adjust the question section's width or the page's zoom level:
      - On Windows, press Ctrl + "-" to zoom out.
      - On Mac, press Cmd + "-" to zoom out.
    This ensures the full question appears in your viewport without scrolling, as the canvas only captures what's visible on screen.
